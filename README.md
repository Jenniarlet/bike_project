##Project Proposal ##

**Situation:**
You are a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclists, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into yearly members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.


**Data Source**
'https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html'
Used a years worth of historical data

Data comes from Divvy, which is a Chicago bike-share system powered by Lyft. This data has been stripped of identifiable information and limited in its columns to focus on driving behavior. The data has been made available by Motivate Internation Inc under this license 'https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement'


**Questions to answer:**
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


**Hypothesis:**
Is there a significant number of members commuters that we can convert to annual members? 
Can we create marketing campaigns targeted at different bike rider personas we see using our bikes
